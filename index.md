## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for innovation, problem-solving, and hands-on design. I’m currently a member of Cornell’s Hyperloop Project Team, where I utilize Ansys Maxwell to research, design, and construct a linear induction motor for a magnetically levitating pod, and I also serve as a Learning Assistant for Physics 2213 (Electricity and Magnetism), helping peers strengthen their understanding of calculus-based physics. My background spans CAD (OnShape, Fusion 360, and SolidWorks), programming in Python and MATLAB, and materials/structural analysis, all complemented by leadership and collaboration experiences through both academic and nonprofit initiatives.

Outside of the classroom, I co-founded the Adirondack Solar Alliance, a nonprofit that has raised over $100,000 to bring renewable energy solutions to communities in Puerto Rico. I’m also passionate about 3D printing, sustainable engineering, and exploring new technologies that push boundaries. In my free time a really enjoy mountain biking, skiing, cliff jumping, playing soccer, and pickleball.
