## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for innovation, problem-solving, and hands-on design. I’m currently a member of Cornell’s Hyperloop Project Team, where I contribute to the design and analysis of high-speed, magnetically levitating pods, and I also serve as a Learning Assistant for Physics 1112, helping peers strengthen their understanding of calculus-based physics. My background spans CAD, programming in Python, and materials/structural analysis, all complemented by leadership and collaboration experiences through both academic and nonprofit initiatives.

Outside of the classroom, I co-founded the Adirondack Solar Alliance, a nonprofit that has raised over $100,000 to bring renewable energy solutions to communities in Puerto Rico. I’m also passionate about 3D printing, sustainable engineering, and exploring new technologies that push boundaries. When I’m not designing or building, you’ll probably find me mountain biking, skiing, cliff jumping, or playing soccer and pickleball.
