For ENGRD 2210 (Thermodynamics) we ran a series of experiments on a given heat exchanger setup. Below contains a description of the device and how it works, various computations exploring the physics of its operation, and analysis on potential changes to the device.

#### Photos and Schematic
The heat exchanger used has four labeled ports. Using these ports and specific arrangements of the tubing carrying the fluids, the heat exchanger can be set up in parallel flow or counter flow. Below is an image of the heat exchanger set up. Note: in this image, the exchanger is in parallel flow.

Then, the heat exchanger was changed to counter-flow in which the fluids are now flowing in opposite directions through the heat exchanger as pictured below:

It can be observed that on the left hand side is a red cooler with blue liquid, representing our cold fluid, while the red fluid on the right is our hot fluid. The cold was ahcieved through ice and an insulated bag, while the hot fluid was heated with an electic heater. The two setups can be summarized in the two schematics below:
